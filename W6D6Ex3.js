//Exercise 3 : What’s in my wallet ?
//Instructions
//Note: Read the illustration (point 4), while reading the instructions

//Create a function named changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange) that 
//      receives two arguments :
        //an item price
        //and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket.
    let quarters=0.25;
    let dimes=0.1;
    let nickel=0.05;
    let penny=0.01;
    function changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange){
        let totalChange = amountOfChange[0] * quarters
                    + amountOfChange[1] * dimes
                    + amountOfChange[2] * nickel
                    + amountOfChange[3] * penny;

        if (itemPrice<=totalChange) {
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }

//In the function, determine whether or not you can afford the item.
        //If the sum of the change is bigger or equal than the item’s 
        // price (ie. it means that you can afford the item), the function 
        // should return true
        //If the sum of the change is smaller than the item’s price (ie. 
        // it means that you cannot afford the item) the function should 
        // return false

//Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.

    //A quarters is 0.25
    //A dimes is 0.10
    //A nickel is 0.05
    //A penny is 0.01



    //4. To illustrate:

//After you created the function, invoke it like this:

console.log(changeEnough(4.25, [25, 20, 5, 0]));
console.log(changeEnough(10, [25, 20, 5, 0]));
console.log(changeEnough(10, [30, 20, 50, 0]));


    //The value 4.25 represents the item’s price
    //The array [25, 20, 5, 0] represents 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies.
    //The function should return true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50 which is bigger than 4.25 (the total amount due)


//Examples

//changeEnough(14.11, [2,100,0,0]) => returns false
//changeEnough(0.75, [0,0,20,5]) => returns true
