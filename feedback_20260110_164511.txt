suggestions for improvement:
- The code in `anagrams.py` does implement the menu, input validation, and output formatting as described in the instructions. However, the most crucial part, the actual `AnagramChecker` class and its methods, is missing. The provided `anagrams.py` relies on an external `anagram_checker.py` which isn't given, so the functionality of finding valid words and anagrams is not implemented here, meaning the code cannot fully solve the problem.
- The code needs to have `AnagramChecker` created in a separate file, as requested in instructions
- The UI should be made to run until a valid word is written, as shown in the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The file loading should handle the zip file provided instead of a plain text file named 'words.txt'.
- The isvalid_word method name does not match the instructions, should be `is_valid_word`.
- The handling of the FileNotFoundError is good, but the error message could be more informative, indicating the expected file name.
- Consider improving performance by using a dictionary to store the sorted word lists, instead of sorting each word on every comparison.
