suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a __str__ method to provide a user-friendly string representation, separate from __repr__ which is more for debugging.
- The code could be slightly more concise by using a conditional expression for pluralizing the currency in `__repr__`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code should be encapsulated within a function to adhere to the instructions. This makes the code reusable and organized.
- The date format should not be hardcoded to allow for the user to enter it as an argument. The function should accept the birthdate as an argument.

suggestions for improvement:
- Create a function to encapsulate the user generation logic as instructed in Exercise 7.
- Avoid using separate lists for names, addresses, and language codes; directly create dictionaries within the loop for better readability and efficiency.
- The final `print(users_list)` statement displays just the list of names, which is not the complete list of dictionaries as intended. It should print the `users_dict_list`.
