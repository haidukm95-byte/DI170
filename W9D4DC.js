//Instructions

//Using this array:

const gameInfo = [
 {
   username: "john",
   team: "red",
   score: 5,
   items: ["ball", "book", "pen"]
 },
 {
   username: "becky",
   team: "blue",
   score: 10,
   items: ["tape", "backpack", "pen"]
 },
 {
   username: "susy",
   team: "red",
   score: 55,
   items: ["ball", "eraser", "pen"]
 },
 {
   username: "tyson",
   team: "green",
   score: 1,
   items: ["book", "pen"]
 },
];

//Create an array using forEach that contains all the usernames from the gameInfo array, 
// add an exclamation point (ie. “!”) to the end of every username.
//The new array should look like this :

 //   const usernames = ["john!", "becky!", "susy!", "tyson!"]
const usernames=[]
gameInfo.forEach(val=>{
    usernames.push(val.username+'!')
})
console.log(usernames)

//2. Create an array using forEach that contains the usernames of all players with a 
// score bigger than 5.
    //The new array should look like this :

    //const winners = ["becky", "susy"]
const winners=[]
gameInfo.filter(val=>val.score>5).forEach(val=>{
    winners.push(val.username)
})
console.log(winners)
//3. Find and display the total score of the users. (Hint: The total score is 71)
const totalScore=gameInfo.map(val=>val.score).reduce((acc, val)=>{
    return acc+val
}, 0)
console.log(totalScore)
