INSERT INTO customer_review(film_id, language_id, title, score, review_text) VALUES
	(1, 1, 'Alejandro E', 10, 'The simple trick inspired by a real event still works, despite the passing of time. The straightforward story of a crime that went wrong is 
	still relevant today, making it a classic of the 1990s.'),
	(1, 1, 'Patrick S', 10, 'A true Coen masterpiece. A funny crime movie. Frances McDormand is brilliant however all acting performances are of a high level. This is one to 
	watch several times and it never gets dull.'),
	(1, 1, 'Maksim S', 8, 'Fargo is a brilliantly dark comedy-crime gem, set against the icy, 
	unforgiving backdrop of Minnesota. The cast delivers fantastic performances across the 
	board, from Frances McDormand’s unforgettable Marge Gunderson to William H. Macy’s 
	bumbling criminal, creating a world that feels simultaneously believable and absurd. 
	While the film claims to be “based on true events,” research quickly shows that the 
	story is entirely fictional—a detail that only enhances the darkly comic tone. The Coen 
	brothers balance tension, deadpan humor, and moral absurdity with impeccable precision, 
	crafting a film that is funny, chilling, and endlessly memorable. Fargo is a masterclass 
	in storytelling where every icy snowfall and quirky accent adds to the darkly hilarious 
	atmosphere. '),
	(1, 1, 'Hunter L', 8, 'I had to watch it for film class. Not really my preferred genre, 
	so I was surprised how much I liked it. Has great cinematography and music that really 
	sets the scene. The characters are compelling and the plot keeps tension throughout, 
	though it is not anything out of this world. Overall, a solid experience.'),
	(2, 1, 'Ember W', 10, 'I am not an action movie type person, but I still loved The 
	Matrix because it is so intelligent, intriguing, and full of deeper themes to dive 
	into and ponder. The plot line is airtight and I found myself getting more and more 
	engaged and excited as the movie went on. Even though there is violence, it was not 
	gratuitous and made sense within the context of the story line. And some of the 
	special effects were so unique and unlike anything I have seen before. I also like 
	that there is some romance sprinkled in because it helps to humanize the characters. 
	After 25 years, I understand the hype.'),
	(2, 1, 'Patrick S', 8, 'The first is the best. The sequels are worthwile except for the 4th which sucks'),
	(2, 1, 'Jack F', 7, 'Watch it once. If you watch it twice, it will be boring. 
	But you simply cannot go through your whole life without watching the Matrix. And if 
	you have not seen it yet, you are stupid. '),
	(5, 1, 'Obi-wan K', 1, 'I regret everything after watching this movie'),
	(5, 1, 'Jasper B', 7, 'One of the best game adaptations and anybody who says otherwise is wrong'),
	(5, 1, 'Bartilek C', 10, 'This movie is BAD. STUPID. And got Poor writing. However, the reason it 
	gets 5 stars is because it is POSTAL we are talking about. Edgy jokes are a PART of the 
	series, and Uwe Boll captured it nicely in my opinion. It DOES NOT NEED good writing, 
	because it is POSTAL. It is like expecting a touching, heartbreaking story from a film 
	for Toddlers.');
