suggestions for improvement:
- The `is_anagram` method is missing. While the logic is incorporated within `get_anagrams`, creating a dedicated method as instructed would improve modularity.
- Consider separating the file loading logic into its own method for better organization and testability.
- Handle potential errors during file reading more gracefully, perhaps logging the error instead of just printing to the console.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the menu printing into its own function for better organization.
- The 'end' string is printed only when quitting. Consider printing it after a game is played as well.
